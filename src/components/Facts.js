            “A tan is the skin’s reaction to exposure to UV rays,” says Miller. “Recognizing exposure to the rays as an ‘insult,’ the skin acts in self-defense by producing more melanin, a pigment that darkens the skin. Over time, this damage will lead to prematurely aged skin and, in some cases, skin cancer.

            Two types of UV radiation that penetrate the skin are UV-B and UV-A rays.

            UV-B rays penetrate the top layers of skin and are most responsible for sunburns.
            UV-A rays penetrate to the deeper layers of the skin and are often associated with allergic reactions, such as a rash."
